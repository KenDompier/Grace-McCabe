                    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m Grace McCabe, a passionate storyteller and creative mind who delights in crafting silly stories, hosting themed watch parties, and indulging in long walks on the beach. My absolute favorite movie? <em>The VelociPastor</em> (2017) — a cinematic masterpiece that never fails to inspire my imagination.</p>

                    <p><strong> >> Education</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>I graduated from the University of Iowa with a Bachelor of Arts in Cinema, complemented by minors in News & Media Literacy and Human Relations. During my time at university (August 2018 - May 2022), I proudly balanced my studies with athletics as a scholarship runner on the cross-country and track & field teams, even becoming a 4x800m relay record holder. I also got involved in student-led video productions and was part of <em>The Doily Allergen</em> group, where creativity and collaboration thrived.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>>> Experience</strong></p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, I’m part of the Front of House Staff at FILMSCENE in Iowa City, where I blend my love for cinema with exceptional customer service. My journey in the film world began at the University of Iowa, where I served as a Video Production Assistant (August 2022 - July 2024), creating engaging content for collegiate athletic programs, particularly for Women’s Soccer, Field Hockey, Gymnastics, and Swimming.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the Director of Social Media Outreach for the Cedar Rapids Independent Film Festival (November 2022 - September 2023), I managed film critique sessions, liaised with filmmakers, and engaged with the community through exciting events. My internship at the festival laid the foundation for my role in creating impactful social media marketing content.</p>
                    
                    <p>I've also contributed to University of Iowa Health Care as a Video Production Student, where I produced heartwarming videos, including the 2021 Kid Captain series. My experience further extends to leading marketing efforts as the Marketing & Operations Director for the University of Iowa Student Video Productions, where I wore many hats—from managing budgets to directing and producing content.</p>
                    
                    <p>When I’m not immersed in the world of film, you can find me sharing laughs with friends, discovering new films, or dreaming up my next creative project. I believe in the power of storytelling and its ability to connect us all, and I’m excited to continue my journey in this vibrant community of creatives!</p>
